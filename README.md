## B.E.A.P-Article-Blog-Page
* **Purpose of the app:** 
   This app is ceated to encourage users to explore different ideas as well as their own ideas and finding a platform to share them publicly. In addition, rather than hire a technical writer or journalist, this app also allows users to create their own news articles on our website “B.E.A.P Your Thought”. 
* **How to use:**
   Users must create a login in order to contribute to the web application. Guests are not allowed to create an article. After signing up, the user has the option to create an article, view their previous articles and view the most recent articles of the web application. If the user decides to create a new article, it will be placed in rotation to be featured on the home page as recent article. Users also have the ability to like and comment on articles posted by other users.
* **Features on the app:**
    The most popular articles are also featured on the home page as well. The popular articles are graded by the number of likes users and guests have given the article. Number of likes are not limited. While on the home page guest and users can sort through articles by the topics, such as Health, Sports, Food, Culture, etc. At any time, the guest or user may return to the home page by clicking the B.E.A.P logo. In order to exit, the user must sign-out under the profile tab.
