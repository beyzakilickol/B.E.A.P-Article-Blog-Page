<!--What's an "Action Page"?
An action page is a page/script that takes the contents of your form, and does something with them.

For example, this action page sends you an email whenever anyone submits their feedback. Another action page could take the comments from your comment box, insert them into a database, then display them your web page.

To create an action page, you need to be reasonably well-versed in a scripting language such as PHP or ColdFusion.

The action page will require different code depending on what exactly you need to do. For example, you might want to implement security measures to check that the comment doesn't look like spam. You might want to check that the form was in fact submitted from your website. You might also want to check the length of your users' comments etc.  -->
